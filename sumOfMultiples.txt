; populate a list with multiples of our integer
; sum that same list
; add the two sums together.


foreach  number between 0 & 10 the condition is divisible by 3 or 5 mod(%)
or
foreach number below limit (parameter)
add multiple to variable(i)-- i being used in the for loop
then add variable amount to running sum


(let loop ((i 5))
(print "i is " i ".\n")
(if (> i 0) (loop (- i 1))))

(let loop ((i 0))
(print "i is " i ".\n")
(if (< i 5) (loop (+ i 1))))


(let loop ((i 0))
(print "multiples of " i " are: \n")
(if(< i 10) (loop (+ i 3))))
